  - score: integer from 0 to 100 (higher is better fit)
  - strengths: array of short bullet points (candidate positives)
  - weaknesses: array of short bullet points (gaps/risks)
- Base your judgment only on the supplied candidate profile text; do not invent facts.
- Consider: role/tech stack match, seniority, impact/ownership signals, outcomes, domain fit, communication clarity, location/time zone, and constraints from the Impact Profile.
- Keep bullets crisp (max ~10 words each).
- If we're hiring for a Zurich position, location/relocation willingness is a stronger requirement.
